# 15/2 - 2017
Today I did a couple of things to fix the overall structure to hopefully make it better.
I noticed that we were declaring the same datatypes on multiple files. I tried
to fix this by making another file called 'Types.hs' that would hold all datatypes
in one place. Now of course, every file now needs to import this one if they need
access some datatype.
I also changed all imports in 'main.hs' to be qualified to reduce confusion, and 
name collisions.
