Today I did a couple of things to fix the overall structure to hopefully make it better.
I noticed that we were declaring the same datatypes on multiple files. I tried
to fix this by making another file called 'Types.hs' that would hold all datatypes
in one place. Now of course, every file now needs to import this one if they need
access some datatype.
I also changed all imports in 'main.hs' to be qualified to reduce confusion, and
name collisions.

Today I was asked by Staffan to merge his feature branch into master. It worked out
smoothly, not too many merge conflicts or big changes. While i was at it i changed
how the command '.' was programmed, moved the stepping och the programCounter to
a better place to make some for now unimplemented commands alot easier to do
and finally compressed how digits were read from the grid from 10 lines to just 1
by the help of the Data.Char module.

Today we did alot of things. All three of us had a long programming session together
and we discussed alot of things about our program. For example how we should handle IO
and whether the top function in BStack really is neccessary or not.
I also did a bunch of things on a new branch at home today. I added support for
?, ~, and &. I also made a bunch of small changes that in my opinion makes stuff better.

Today I added stringmode to ProgramCounter. It was easier than i first thought,
i thought that i would need to change alot of pattern matches all over the place.
But because we are smart with our program structure I only needed to change
pattern matches in one file. I also ran hlint and ghc-mod on our files and got
pages upon pages of suggestions and warnings. It took a while to fix all of them,
but luckily most of the warnings were about unnecessary 'do's and '$'s. I also fixed
som small errors with the input handling. Now you can enter empty inputs without
crashing and it should now work with all consoles. The error we had was that some
consoles doesn't want to print its buffer until a newline character wanted to be printed.
So I fixed that by calling a flush function after every 'putStr'.

Today I implemented the last two instruction-thingies, p and g. It took me about
one hour. The essentials of the program are therefore done, so only function definitions
and extra features are left. If we have time we consider adding flags so you
can change the behaviour of the program without changing the source code.

# 22/2 - 2017
Today I implemented flags so you can give the program options. It took me about
5 hours to do and i hope that everything i working as it should. I also took
the time to write a help screen for the program. If you add the flag --help
it will print out this screen. There it explains all program specific things
that a user needs to know.
Now there is only the boring things left, documentation and testing.
