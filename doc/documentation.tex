\section{Introduction}
We introduce the programming language Befunge-93 as well as its stack, program space and program flow.
\label{sec:intro}

\subsection{What is Befunge-93?}
\label{sec:whatis}

Befunge-93 (sometimes in this document simply “Befunge”) is a two-dimensional esoteric programming language developed by Chris Pressey in 1993 \cite{esolangs}. The program to be executed is stored in a 80 by 25 grid, the “program space”, where each cell can hold 1 byte of data. There are no variables available but data can be stored in either a LIFO-stack (last-in-first-out) or, by using the \code{p} instruction, in the program space itself. This allows for the program to modify itself while running. See section \ref{sec:pandg} “\nameref{sec:pandg}”.

Befunge-93 was the first iteration of several Befunge-specifications which eventually lead to Funge-98, a generalization of in which program spaces can be either one-, two-, or three-dimensional. Funge-98 also provides a paradigm for program spaces in an arbitrary number of dimensions \cite{funge98}. Besides new dimensions, Funge-98 also specifies several new instructions as well as concurrent program flow and a stack of stacks.

\subsection{The stack}
\label{sec:stack}

The stack has the property that it is never truly empty. Instead, if an attempt to pop a value of the stack is made when the stack is thought to be empty, a value of \code{0} is returned. The stack is in all but this one regard a regular LIFO-stack.

When referring to the stack this document will sometimes use the notation $\langle a_n, \cdots, a_1 \rangle$ where $a_1$ is the top-most value of the stack.

\subsection{The program space}
\label{sec:space}

The program space consists of 2,000 cells arranged in a 80 by 25 grid. The upper left corner of this grid is given the coordinate position $(0, 0)$ and the lower right corner is identified as $(79, 24)$, see Figure \ref{fig:grid}.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
$(0, 0)$ & $(1, 0)$ & $\cdots$ & $(79, 0)$\\
\hline
$(0, 1)$ & $(1, 1)$ & $\cdots$ & $(79, 1)$\\
\hline
$\vdots$ & $\vdots$ & $\ddots$ & $\vdots$\\
\hline
$(0, 24)$ & $(1, 24)$ & $\cdots$ & $(79, 24)$\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{A visualization of the program space in Befunge where each cell is labeled with its coordinates.}
\label{fig:grid}
\end{figure}

The grid can topologically be thought of as a torus (the surface of a doughnut); should the Program Counter (see section \ref{sec:pc}) at any point try to move outside the bounds of the program space it “wraps around” to the other side. For example, assuming that indexing starts at 0, if the Program Counter (see section \ref{sec:pc}) is at position (6, 24) and attempts to move South, its new position would be (6, 0), still facing South.

In this document we will use “program space”, “space”, “program memory” and “memory” synonymously.

\subsection{Program flow and the Program Counter}
\label{sec:pc}

Program flow is determined by the position (in the program space) and direction of a unique Program Counter, often simply called the “PC”. The position is usually represented as a pair $(x, y)$ of coordinates and the direction is always one of either East, South, West or North. Traveling East increases the $x$-component of the PC's position, and traveling West decreases it. Traveling South or North works analogously.

The PC starts at position (0, 0) -- the upper-left corner of the program space -- and has an initial direction of East. Execution of any Befunge program then consists of three simple steps:
\begin{enumerate}

\item Read the character at the PC's position in the program space.
\item Execute the instruction corresponding to the character that was read.
\item Step the PC one step in its direction.

\end{enumerate}
These three steps are repeated until an \code{@}-character is read at which point the program immediately terminates. See section \ref{sec:interpreterflow} for more information on program flow of the interpreter.

\section{Running the interpreter}
\label{sec:howtorun}

The interpreter has no graphical user interface and is run for the command line.

\subsection{Dependencies}
\label{sec:dependencies}

The interpreter requires a few packages that doesn't come with the base package from a fresh install of \code{GHC}:

\begin{itemize}
\item The module \code{System.Random} from the package \code{random-1.1} or newer.
\item The module \code{Data.Array.IO} from the package \code{array-0.5.1.1} or newer.
\item The module \code{Data.Hashmap.Strict} from the package \code{unordered-containers-0.2.7.2} or newer.
\item The module \code{Data.Hashable} from the package \code{hashable-1.2.5.0} or newer.
\item The module \code{Test.HUnit} from the package \code{HUnit-1.5.0.0} or newer.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Running}
\label{sec:run}

Given a compiled program \code{main} (or \code{main.exe} on Windows) -- for example compiled with \code{ghc main.hs} -- the interpreter can be run from the terminal by
$$\code{./main filename}$$
on Linux and
$$\code{main.exe filename}$$
on Windows, where \code{filename} is the name of the Befunge program to be read. The interpreter can also be run without explicit compilation by using
$$\code{runhaskell main.hs filename}.$$
This requires the command prompt to be in the same directory as the file \code{main.hs}.

\subsection{Command-line arguments}
\label{sec:args}

The interpreter can take two arguments:

\vspace{6pt}
\noindent
\code{--debug}, \code{-d} : Print verbose debug messages while running.

\vspace{6pt}
\noindent
\code{--help}, \code{-h}, \code{?} : Print help message and exit.

\vspace{6pt}
\noindent
Flags should be given before the file name, for example:
$$\code{main -d foo.b93}$$

\section{Instruction list}
\label{sec:instructions}

Befunge-93 specifies a total of 35 actions each represented by an ASCII character. Arithmetic is executed using Reverse Polish Notation (RPN).

Table \ref{tab:instr} contains a complete list of all characters that the interpreter recognizes. If the PC encounters an unrecognized character, it ignores it completely -- as if it were a space (\textvisiblespace).


\begin{table}[!hb]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{r|l}
Character & Action\\
\hline
\code{0} -- \code{9} & Push the desired value onto the stack.\\
\code{+} & Pop \code{b} and \code{a} off the stack, then push $\code{a} + \code{b}$.\\
\code{-} & Pop \code{b} and \code{a}. Push $\code{a} - \code{b}$.\\
\code{*} & Pop \code{b}, \code{a}. Push $\code{a} \cdot \code{b}$.\\
\code{/} & Pop \code{b}, \code{a}. Push \code{0} if $\code{b} = \code{0}$, otherwise the integer part of $\code{a} / \code{b}$.\\
\code{\%} & Pop \code{b}, \code{a}. Push $\code{a} \text{ mod } \code{b}$.\\
\code{\`{}} & Pop \code{b} and \code{a}. If $\code{a} > \code{b}$ then push \code{1}, otherwise push \code{0}.\\
\code{!} & Pop \code{a} and if \code{a} is non-zero then push \code{0}, otherwise push \code{1}.\\
\code{>} & Instruct the PC to move East.\\
\code{v} & Instruct the PC to move South.\\
\code{<} & Instruct the PC to move West.\\
\code{\^} & Instruct the PC to move North.\\
\code{?} & Instruct the PC to move in a random cardinal direction.\\
\code{\#} & Skip the next instruction.\\
\code{\_} & Pop \code{a} and instruct the PC to move West if $\code{a} \neq \code{0}$, otherwise East.\\
\code{|} & Pop \code{a} and instruct the PC to move North if $\code{a} \neq \code{0}$, otherwise South.\\
\code{:} & Duplicate the top value of the stack.\\
\code{\textbackslash} & Swap the top two values of the stack.\\
\code{\$} & Pop a value off the stack and discard it.\\
\code{g} & Pop \code{y} and \code{x}, then push the value of the character at position $(\code{x}, \code{y})$.\\
\code{p} & Pop \code{y}, \code{x} and \code{v}, then insert \code{v} at position $(\code{x}, \code{y})$ in the memory.\\
\code{\&} & Wait for user value input and push it.\\
\code{\textasciitilde} & Wait for user character input and push its ASCII value.\\
\code{.} & Pop a value and print it, followed by a space (\textvisiblespace).\\
\code{,} & Pop a value and print its ASCII character.\\
\code{"} & Toggles string mode, see section \ref{sec:stringmode}.\\
\code{\textvisiblespace} & Spaces are ignored, the PC continues and no other modifications are made.\\
\code{@} & Terminate the program.
\end{tabular}
\caption{All instructions supported by the interpreter.}
\label{tab:instr}
\end{table}

\subsection{String mode}
\label{sec:stringmode}

When the PC encounters a \code{"}-character it toggles what is called “string mode”. When string mode is enabled, all subsequent characters read have their ASCII value pushed onto the stack without executing any action. String mode is then enabled until the PC encounters a \code{"}-character again. For example, the program \code{"@".@} prints \code{64} before terminating.

\section{Example programs}
\label{sec:examples}

We provide examples of Befunge programs and explain in detail how they are executed.

\subsection{Basic arithmetic}
\label{sec:arith}

Addition (\code{+}), subtraction (\code{-}), multiplication (\code{*}), division (\code{/}) and modulo (\code{\%}) execute using Reverse Polish Notation (RPN). That is, the program snippet \code{65-.} prints $1$ (and not $-1$). Divison by \code{0} pushes \code{0} back to the stack regardless of the value of the numerator.

An example that utilizes all of these instructions is the following program:
$$\code{329*+2*7/4\%.@}$$
It first pushes \code{3}, \code{2} and \code{9} to the stack followed by a multiplication of the top two values making the stack look like $\langle 3, 18 \rangle$, where the right-most value is the top of the stack. The \code{+} instruction adds the top two values on the stack; the stack now contains a single value of 21. This is then multiplied by \code{2} and divided by \code{7} resulting in the stack $\langle 6 \rangle$. Finally, a \code{4} is pushed and the modulo operation \code{\%} calculates $6 \text{ mod } 4 = 2$ and pushes it. The top value on the stack, now \code{2}, is printed by \code{.} and the program stops after reading the \code{@}-character.

\subsection{Moving around}
\label{sec:movement}

There are 7 instructions that can change the direction of the Program Counter: \code{>}, \code{v}, \code{<}, \code{\^}, \code{?}, \code{\_} and \code{|}. We explain what \code{\_} and \code{|} do in section \ref{sec:ifs} “\nameref{sec:ifs}”. The first four instructions should be thought of as arrows; they change the direction of the PC so that it moves in the direction indicated by these “arrows”. The questionmark symbol \code{?} randomizes the direction of the PC to one of four cardinal directions (i.e. one of East, North, South or West).

An example of the four basic move-instructions is shown in Figure \ref{fig:basicmove}. It makes use the the wrap-around property of the program space and never terminates, despite having a termination symbol in the center.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\centering
\code{< \^{}}\\
\code{@}\\
\code{v >}
\caption{A never-ending Befunge program.}
\label{fig:basicmove}
\end{figure}

Infinite loops are indeed easy to create; simply force the PC in a path that does not contain any termination symbol.

\subsection{Input and output}
\label{sec:io}

Input can be asked for by \code{\&} for numerical values and \code{\~} for single-character inputs. Output is given by \code{.} and \code{,} for numeric and ASCII-characters respectively. For example, the 3 character long program \code{\~{}.@} asks for a character input and prints its numerical value before terminating. The program \code{\&:!\#@\_.} asks for numerical inputs and echoes whatever the user entered until the users enters \code{0}.

When an input is asked for, the program pauses and “\code{>{}>}” is printed to the console to indicate that a value (or character) should be entered. After a value (or character) is entered, the program resumes. Should more than one value be entered, everything but the first value is ignored.

\subsection{If-statements}
\label{sec:ifs}

The characters \code{\_} and \code{|} are conditionals; one value is popped off the stack and the PC changes direction to West and North respectively if the value is non-zero, otherwise East and South, respectively.

Discarding all values from the stack until a \code{0} is on top is hence very easy: \code{>\_@}. If a string is pushed onto the stack it is also easy to print it, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:print}.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\centering
\code{"egnufeB">:\#v\_@}\\
\code{\hspace{3.5em}\^{} ,<}
\caption{Printing a string in Befunge. The program prints \code{Befunge}. Note that the string is pushed reversely onto the stack and that the program ends when \code{0} is found on the stack.}
\label{fig:print}
\end{figure}

\subsection{\code{g}etting and \code{p}utting values}
\label{sec:pandg}

Values from the program space can be retrieved using the get-command \code{g}; it pops the values \code{y} and \code{x} from the stack and pushes whichever character is at position $(\code{x}, \code{y})$. The put-instruction \code{p} pops \code{y} and \code{x} as well as a third value \code{v}, and then inserts \code{v} at position $(\code{x}, \code{y})$ in the program space.

These instructions can make for particularly confusing code, for example the program \code{444**00p} (or equivalently \code{4::**0:p}) which at first glance does not seem to terminate. However, \code{444**} pushes 64 (ASCII character \code{@}) to the stack which is then put into the program space at position $(\code{0}, \code{0})$ by \code{00p}. The program then wraps around the right “edge” of the program space and appears at $(\code{0}, \code{0})$ where there is now a termination symbol, \code{@}, and hence does terminate.

\subsection{Determining prime numbers}

A more complicated example is one that takes a number and determines whether it is a prime number or not. One solution, designed to be obscure and hard to read, is shown in Figure \ref{fig:prime}.

The very first row asks for a numeric input, say $n$, and outputs \code{0} (indicating “False”) if $n \leq 1$. The value is then compared to \code{3} on line two and if $n \leq 3$ (i.e. $n$ is either 2 or 3) then \code{1} (“True”) is printed. If $n > 3$ the PC now travels South in the left-most column. $r_2 = n \text{ mod } 2$ is calculated and if $r_2 = 0$ (meaning $n$ is an even number) then the program terminates after printing \code{0}.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\centering
\code{\&::1\`{}\#v\_0.@}\\
\code{\hspace{-2em}v\_v\#\`{}3<}\\
\code{\hspace{-2.5em}:\hspace{.5em}>1.@}\\
\code{\hspace{-3em}2>p1v}\\
\code{\hspace{-2em}\%:v2<\#<}\\
\code{\hspace{-4em}\#0+}\\
\code{\hspace{-4em}>\^{}:}\\
\code{\hspace{-.5em}|>0\$\%\#\^{}\_  \$}\\
\code{\hspace{-4em}\$\textbackslash:}\\
\code{\hspace{-2em}.\^{}g:0:<}\\
\code{@ >\textbackslash\`{}\#\^{}\_1.\$}
\caption{A primality test in Befunge, designed to be obscure.}
\label{fig:prime}
\end{figure}

If the program has not yet terminated we know that $n$ is an odd integer such that $n \geq 5$. The value $n$ is stored at position (0, 0) in the program space (replacing the initial \code{\&}-character) and then the main primality testing loop begins (at position (4, 4)) with a single value of \code{1} on the stack (pushed at position (3, 3)).

When the loop starts it increments whatever is on the top of the stack by 2 and duplicates the new value, call it $k$. It then uses the \code{g}-command to get the value on position (0,0), i.e. the number $n$ we stored earlier. The two top-most values on the stack are swapped (the stack is now equal to $\langle k, n, k \rangle$) and a comparison $n > k$ is performed using the \code{\`{}}-character. If the comparison $n > k$ is false (i.e. $n \leq k$) then \code{1} is printed and the program terminates (after wrapping around to position (0, 10)).

Otherwise, if $n > k$, then the program duplicates the stack's top value, pushes the stored $n$ again (using \code{g}) and swaps the stack's top elements (making the stack look like $\langle k, n, k \rangle$ again). We now calculate $n \text{ mod } k$ and terminate with a printed \code{0} if $n \equiv 0 \mod k$. Otherwise the PC goes back to the beginning of the loop and increments the top value of the stack by 2 again.

Effectively what happens, after checking base cases, is that we calculate $r_k = n \text{ mod } k$ and ensure that it is non-zero for all odd $3 \leq k < n$.

\section{Implementation}
\label{sec:impl}

In which we discuss how the interpreter is implemented, including the data structures and algorithms used.

\subsection{Data structures}
\label{sec:structures}

empty

\subsubsection{Stack}
\label{sec:structstack}

The Befunge stack, defined in \code{BStack.hs}, is implemented using a list of integers. It exports one identifier (\code{empty}) and three functions (\code{push}, \code{pop}, \code{top}). The type \code{BStack} is defined as a list of integers: \code{newtype BStack = BStack [Int] deriving (Show)}. The identifier \code{empty} (of type \code{BStack}) is identified simply as \code{BStack [\hspace{2pt}]}.

\vspace{6pt}
\noindent
\code{push} (\code{BStack -> Int -> Bstack}) takes a (possibly empty) stack \code{s} and an integer \code{n}, and returns \code{s} with \code{n} on top.

\vspace{6pt}
\noindent
\code{pop} (\code{BStack -> (BStack, Int)}) takes a stack \code{s} and returns a tuple \code{(s', t)} where \code{t} is the top element of \code{s} and \code{s'} is \code{s} with \code{t} removed. If \code{s} is empty, a tuple \code{(BStack [\hspace{2pt}], 0)} is returned instead.

\vspace{6pt}
\noindent
\code{top} (\code{BStack -> Int}) takes a stack and returns its top element without modifying the stack.

\vspace{6pt}
\noindent
All three functions have precondition \code{True}.

\subsubsection{Program space}
\label{sec:structmem}

The Befunge program space, the “memory”, is constructed using an array. \code{BMemory.hs} is a wrapper for an \code{IOArray} (from \code{Data.Array.IO}) and the type \code{BMemory} is synonymous to \code{IOArray Position Char}. It exports three functions:

\vspace{6pt}
\noindent
\code{buildArray} (\code{BMemory -> [String] -> IO ()}) allocates an array and populates it with the characters in a list of strings. Any characters outside the bounds (defaults to $80 \times 25$) are ignored.

\vspace{6pt}
\noindent
\code{getValue} (\code{BMemory -> Position -> IO Char}) takes an array and returns the character at the given position.

\vspace{6pt}
\noindent
\code{putValue} (\code{BMemory -> Position -> Char -> IO ()}) takes an array, a position and a value. It inserts the value at the given position and returns nothing.

\vspace{6pt}
\noindent
Both \code{getValue} and \code{putValue} wraps array indices using modulus.

\subsection{Algorithms}
\label{sec:algorithms}

Describing in detail the few simple algorithms this interpreter has.

\subsubsection{BuildMemory}
\label{sec:buildMemory}

This algorithm is executed in the function \code{buildMemory} in the module \code{BMemory} and is responsible for converting a textfile with befunge code to a grid in memory. The textfile is represented as a list of strings (\code{[String]}) where every string is a line from top to bottom in the file. The creation of the \code{BMemory} itself is performed elsewhere, this algorithm only fills an \code{BMemory} with the correct values.

The algorithm is as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\itemsep-0.5em
\item set $y=0$
\item take the line at row $y$
\item set $x=0$
\item get the character $c$ at column $x$ at line $y$
\item set the cell at position $(x, y)$ in \code{memory} to $c$
\item increase $x$ by $1$
\item \code{if (x >= 80 or endOfLine)} continue \code{else} goto 4
\item increase $y$ by $1$
\item \code{if (y >= 25 or endOfFile)} continue \code{else} goto 2
\item done
\end{enumerate}

The first character on the first line in the file is put at position $(0, 0)$, the second character at position $(1, 0)$ etc. until it reaches the end of the line, or it has read 80 characters (width of the grid). Then the row is increased by 1 and the algorithm repeats the last part. The first character at this next row is put at position $(0, 1)$, the next at $(1, 1)$ etc. The algorithm finally stops when the file doesn't have anymore lines, or if it has read 25 lines.

\subsubsection{ParseFlags}
\label{sec:parseFlags}

This algorithm is executed in the function \code{parseFlags} in the module \code{Flags}. It takes a \code{[String]} with all commandline arguments (or flags) and parses them, extracting the information in them and puts that in a \code{HashMap}. The \code{HashMap} maps \code{Flag} to a \code{String} $s$, where $s$ is some kind of information about the flag (usually "True" or "False") and \code{Flag} is a datatype enumerating all possible flags; \code{Filename}, \code{Debug} and \code{Help}. A key-value pair for the \code{HashMap} will be written as (\code{k $\Rightarrow$ v}) in this document.

The algorithm step by step:
\begin{enumerate}
\itemsep-0.5em
\item get all flags as $f$
\item let empty $\code{HashMap} = h$
\item \code{if ($f$ is empty)} throw error "no arguments"
\item let $i = 0$
\item try to parse $f(i)$ to a \code{Flag} and name it $F$
\item \code{if (not successfull)} throw error "invalid flag"
\item \code{if ($f(i)$ is the last one in $f$)} add (\code{Filename} $\Rightarrow f(i)$) to $h$ and goto 11
\item add ($F \Rightarrow "True"$) to $h$
\item increase $i$ by one
\item goto 5
\item return $h$
\end{enumerate}

So this algorithm goes through all flags one by one and tries to parse them and adding themselves to the \code{HashMap}. The last flag is a special case, it is always the \code{Filename}. 

\subsection{Program flow of the interpreter}
\label{sec:interpreterflow}

The interpreter begins in function \code{main} to get the arguments and validates using \code{parseFlags} from the \code{Flags} module. If the arguments are valid, the interpreter proceeds to read the program file in function \code{readProgram}. We initialize interpretation in function \code{initialize} which takes the Befunge program (as text) and stores in an array. It then returns the array together with a default Program Counter (at position (0, 0) and facing East) and empty stack.

The main interpreter loop, which takes place in \code{runProgram}, begins by reading the character at the PC's position from the program space. If string mode is disabled and the character is an \code{@} then the interpreter stops immediately. Otherwise, \code{executeInstruction} is called which, depending on whether string mode is enabled or disabled as well as the character read, calls functions imported from the module \code{BInstructions} where all Befunge instructions are implemented. Finally, the \code{runProgram} calls itself with an updated PC, stack and array.

\section{Shortcomings, caveats and unimplemented ideas}



There are a few shortcomings and caveats that should be noted:

\begin{itemize}

\item Because the program space is effectively an array of Haskell's data type \code{Char}, each cell is capable of holding 1,114,111 values, instead of the 256 values (1 byte) specified in the Befunge documentation \cite{befunge93}.

\item Infinite loops in Befunge programs \emph{can not} be terminated without terminating the interpreter.

\item We had an idea of adding an argument \code{--input}, or \code{-i}, which would take input as an argument to the interpreter rather than during runtime. The idea was briefly implemented but discarded as it seemed unintuitive.

\item Another unimplemented idea was instructions \code{P} and \code{G} which, in contrast to their lower case counterparts, would work on a larger scale. \code{P} would overwrite the original input file with the current program space, and \code{G} would read an entirely new file and store it in the current program space. This was not implemented because we lacked the time.

\end{itemize}
